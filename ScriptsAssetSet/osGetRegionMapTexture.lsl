/*
key osGetRegionMapTexture(string regionNameOrID)
When this script is executed, it retrieves the texture representing the map of the region where the object is located using osGetRegionMapTexture. 
Then, it sets this retrieved map texture as the texture of the object by using llSetTexture. 
This can be useful for creating objects that visually represent the map of the region they are placed in within the OpenSimulator environment.

    state_entry()

        key map = osGetRegionMapTexture(llGetRegionName());
        
        // Set the retrieved map texture as the texture of the object
